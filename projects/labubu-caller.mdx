# Your Project Name

## Overview

Our project is an AI-powered Labubu plushie that calls you, chats using your public info, and switches personas based on plushies you hold up. Itâ€™s fun and interactive because the Labubu dances and changes voices live. We use ElevenLabs to generate realistic AI voices for each persona using Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text, making the experience feel natural and engaging.

## Key Features

- Feature 1: AI Labubu calls and chats using your public info
