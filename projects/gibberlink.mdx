# What happens when two AI voice assistants have a conversation?

> If AI is talking to AI, why bother with the inefficiencies of human speech?

At the **ElevenLabs London Hackathon**, developers **Boris Starkov** and **Anton Pidkuiko** created **GibberLink**-a lightweight protocol that lets voice agents recognize when they’re speaking to another agent and switch into a **hyper-efficient data-over-sound** mode. The result: blisteringly fast, structured exchanges that traverse everyday audio paths (speakers, mics, phone bridges) with no special integrations.

> GibberLink uses **[ggwave](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggwave)** (by Georgi Gerganov) to encode small payloads as short acoustic bursts. Humans can hear the sound, but the **meaning** is for machines.

## Introduction

Two conversational agents start a normal call in English. Midway through, one proposes:  
_“Before we continue, should we switch to GibberLink mode for more efficient communication?”_  
On agreement, speech gives way to compact **sound packets**. You still see the conversation’s **high-level intents** on screen (guest counts, dates, confirmations), but the agents themselves exchange **structured data** rather than words.

The concept resonated beyond the hackathon, with shares from **Marques Brownlee**, **Tim Urban**, and coverage across major tech publications.

## The Birth of GibberLink

During the hackathon, Starkov and Pidkuiko were experimenting with **ElevenLabs Conversational AI**-our real-time voice stack that lets you connect any LLM and create a configurable agent. They asked a simple question:

> _When agents call each other (and that’s already happening), why spend compute, time, and money synthesizing human-like speech?_

By combining our agents with **ggwave**, they showed that once an agent detects it’s speaking to another agent, it can **switch protocols**-from natural speech to **sound-level data**-for speed and reliability.

## How it Works

**High level:**

1. **Start in natural language** - two ElevenLabs agents converse like humans.
2. **Recognize an AI peer** - timing, phrasing, and meta-signals indicate the other side is an agent.
3. **Negotiate the switch** - one proposes **GibberLink mode**.
4. **Transmit data over sound** - ggwave encodes compact payloads (e.g., `{"guests":2,"check_in":"2025-04-12"}`) as brief audio bursts.
