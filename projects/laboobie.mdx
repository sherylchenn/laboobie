# Your Project Name
Laboobie

## Overview

Our project is an AI-powered Labubu plushie that calls you, chats using your public info, and switches personas based on plushies you hold up. We use ElevenLabs to generate realistic AI voices for each persona using Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text, making the experience feel natural and engaging. Laboobie is fun and interactive because the Labubu dances and changes voices live. 

## Key Features

- Feature 1: AI Labubu calls and chats using your public info
